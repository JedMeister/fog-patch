Notes:
As FOG is designed to be installed to a clean Ubuntu (or other) install it will install fine on Core. Regardless I am now using LAMP as a base.
Also some parts of the install (such as setting IP address) need to be in firstboot scripts.
In the default fog-install script, IP setting etc is in fog/lib/commmon/input.sh
