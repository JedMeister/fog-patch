Notes:
IMO rather than use the generic foginstall.sh it would be better to script these bits into the conf file of the patch.
As FOG is designed to be installed to a clean Ubuntu (or other) install I am currently working on a Core install, but seeing as FOG is actually LAMP based it makes more sense tp use TKL LAMP as a base ultimately.
Also some parts of the install (such as setting IP address) need to be in firstboot scripts.
By default IP setting etc is in fog/lib/commmon/input.sh
